# Challenge_03
For this challenge I am doing a financial analysis of Bitcoin from two exchanges Bitstamps and Coinbase.

I collected CSV data and prepared the datasets for analysis by cleaning missing and erroneous data then analyze the data at a high level through summary statistics and visualizations.
Thus I used those informations to select areas for deeper analysis, specifically time periods in which I used to identify an arbitrage opportunities.

I used Python as programming language and I import some of the libraries that we will need like panda, pathlib and matploblib
